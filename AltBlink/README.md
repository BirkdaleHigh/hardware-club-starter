# Circuits and software

The basics. Take a close look at your arduino board you will find all kinds of writing on it. What's most important is the things designating the pins on the board. Mostly numbers from 0 to 13.

# Tasks

## 1. Flash the built in LED

Get the board plugged in and upload to it the example that comes with the software. `File -> Examples -> Basics -> Blink`

When you upload it watch the board and note what it's doing.

## 2 Flash your own LED

Get out the following;

1. Any LED
2. 1 560Ohm Resistor

Using some wires from the kit put you parts into the breadboard so that the signal (power) will come from the correct pin, through the resistor, through the LED and finally down to a ground (any GND pin).

# What did you learn?
#### Can you anwser these yourself?

1. How small can the speed be and you can still see which LED is on and which is off.
1. The same `flip` function runs for both LEDs. Why don't both LEDs light up and go off at the same time?
1. What LED lights when you first boot the board up?
1. Why?
1. What is the syntax of a function?
1. Can you describe what a function is?
