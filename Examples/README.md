The examples folder house .ino files used as demos on the board or in general because they are simple.

You should look in the other folders next to "Examples" for more guided tutorials, projects or explanations.

# Help

To open these files with the Arduino IDE (rather tha VSCode) your .ino filename has to be the same as the folder it is in.

## wrong

```
analog\
    example1.ino
    example3.ino
    mywork.ino
```

## Right

```
analog\
    analog.ino
example1\
    example1.ino
mywork\
    mywork.ino
```
