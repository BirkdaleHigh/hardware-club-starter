# Hardware Club
## Wednesday After School (3:10pm to 4pm) IT Room U5

Learn programming with basic hardware to control lights and motors.  We currently have room for a maximum of 10 people and there's around 5 spots still going. Currently this club is open for year 9 and up to join in. 

Starting next academic year there will be more spots available and a re-cap so anything won't be missed.


# Projects

1. Robot Driving Lesson

With an arduino we will DIY our own brain to drive the [Bigtrak Rovers](http://rover.bigtrakxtr.co.uk/what.html) around a course. This is the frist step on a path to making hardware work for you.

With this project you'll start with zero programming or circuits  knowledge and learn to;

* wire a LED matrix
* use variables
* create your own functions
* use parameters

You will finish this project with an understanding of how to learn something you don't have any idea to do in the first place.
