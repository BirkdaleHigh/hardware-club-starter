# BigTrak Rover Jr.

Make your own brains the to BigTrak Rover with a simple LED array and microcontroller.

## Parts

- Controller (arduino in this case)
- x4 LEDs
- x4 matching resistors (560ohm)
- Some wires and connectors or soldering supplies.
- Something to insulate the wires from each other. Tape or surplus over sized wire you can strip. (Old electrical cable in this case)

## How

The BigTrak Rover is controlled by 4 light-sensitive diodes in a row. Exposing these to light in a specific order controls which motors are powered and the direction. Duration is controlled by the time the diode is lit. 

The app works by holding a phone in a specific place that lights the screen in a specific order for the diodes.

This project will replace the phone.

We need something to hold 4 LEDs in place in front of the diodes and also to pres down on the power switch at the base of the phone clamp.

## Measurements

Card, 65mm width by 40mm* high
Place the tip of the LEDs 20mm up from the bottom of the card relative to the clamp.
Space the LED tips 12.5mm apart starting 15mm from one edge of the board.

* This is a minimum height for the top of the clamp to reach the bottom power switches.
