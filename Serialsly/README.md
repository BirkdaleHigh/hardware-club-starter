# Taking Things Serialsly

The plan is loosely:

* Serial Talking, uses the serial monitor to accept input and perform logic with a  response. 
* Temperature Sensor, analogue input and the serial monitor
* Light Sensor, repeat analogue input and serial monitor.
* Potentiometer, input with analogue and debugging with the serial monitor
* Servo Motor, Move positions with an analogue output.

# Tasks

1. `SerialTalker.ino`
1. `SerialTemp.ino`
1. `SerialLight.ino`
1. ... More to come.
